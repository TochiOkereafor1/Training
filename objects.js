// Allows us to define key--value pairs
// When compared to arrays, objects should be used for more unstructured data, while arrays should be used for more structured data
// When declaring arrays in an object the = sign isn't needs the : sign is used instead
// When declaring objects, it makes sense to use , after each declaration, otherwise a red line will appear.

What is a property?
- a property is information that belongs to an object

What is the advantage of using an object to store something?
- an object isn't stored in any particular index in coparison to an array
- an array is stored in indexes varyin from 0 to what ever.

How do you retrieve data from an object?
- you can use the dot notation or you can simply print the object name to get its contents

how do you add data to an object?
data is added by declaring the object around {} and then inputting the information inside, string within qoutations and numbers as literals

how do you declare an array in an object?
by typing the array name followed by : and then [] where the information will be stored.

How do you get a property from an object?

i was a bit confused as to when to use an object vs Dot notation
i'm sure with more practice will be able to understand it (try using dot and bracket notation)

//When do you use the dot notation?
// used when you want to reference a specific object property


//When do you use the reference notation?
//used when you need to compute using the object property


//Undefined this is what you get when you want to access a property on an object that doesn't exist



/*
what is the bracket and Dot notation in regards to objects?
https://codeburst.io/javascript-quickie-dot-notation-vs-bracket-notation-333641c0f781

We canâ€™t use variables with dot notation. Attempting to lookup
let obj = {
  cat: 'meow',
  dog: 'woof'
};
let dog = 'cat';
let sound = obj.dog;
console.log(sound);
// woof

This is in compariosn to bracket notation where:
let obj = {
  cat: 'meow',
  dog: 'woof'
};
let dog = 'cat';
let sound = obj[dog];
console.log(sound);
// meow

Going over Dot Vs Bracket notation 11:41 and playing with the code will help me understand better.
